## Tizen Xamarin Mobile App

A neat and convenient, but powerful and functional Tizen Xamarin Calculator App developed by Tizen Platform Engineers at Samsung Electronics.

In addition to aesthetically pleasing layout, the Calculator offers two modes: 
 - "Everyday" for casual users who want they calculations being done ASAP with minimum frictions, and 
 - "Scientific" for seasoned researchers who don't hesitate to get their hands dirty in logarithmic and trigonometric manipulations over complicated numbers

The app is in the Preview mode now and temporary available for a wide audience for free.
So harry-up, try it now and let us know your thoughts!

Note the app includes a statistical research module, which sends some app usage patterns to the analytical server.
This will not affect your perfect user experience though.
